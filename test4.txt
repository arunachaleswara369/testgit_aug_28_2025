In generative AI, Transformers are a powerful neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, like text or code, by using a mechanism called attention to understand the relationships between different parts of the sequence, regardless of their distance. This enables them to generate coherent and context-aware outputs, forming the foundation for advanced generative AI models like GPT, which can produce human-like text, images, and other content.
